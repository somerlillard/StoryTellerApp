# StoryTellerApp
Hello! The following files contain the code for an app I made using Android Studio which has 3 main parts. 
First is a PhotoTagger where you can take photos using your device's camera and the resulting photo gets processed by Google Vision API and labelled with descriptive string tags. 
After inspecting the tags you can choose to save this image, it's creation date, and labelled tags in an SQL database. The second aspect of this app is the SketchTagger which has most of 
the same functionality as the PhotoTagger but instead of taking photos using your device you can draw on the app's screen to create a sketch which gets processed and labelled. Similarly 
you can choose whether or not you want to save this sketch, it's date, and tags into a SQL database. Thirdly, and most importantly, the StoryTeller aspect of this app combines the previously
saved databases and allows you to choose which tags from stored images and sketches you would like to use to create a story rendered by TextCortex API. After creating this story, it will then
be read out loud by your device. 

Thanks for reading!
